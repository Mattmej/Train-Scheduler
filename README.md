# Train-Scheduler

### Description

This project demonstrates how to use Google's Firebase database to store and retrieve data. The app also uses jQuery to help streamline the JavaScript code, and Moment.js to calculate times.

When the user enters new train information into the form at the bottom of the page then clicks the "submit" button, the new train is added to the Firebase database. Then the app takes the information from the database and displays it on the webpage's table. All arrival times and minutes until arrival are calculated by Moment.js.

Here is a demonstration of a user adding a new train to the Firebase database, with the app displaying the updated database information to the screen (this gif was created at 6:45 pm):
